# Roadmap to a Profitable Lawn-Mowing Service (Grand Junction, CO)

Launch, grow, and sustain a solo lawn-mowing venture that achieves ~70 % margins within the first season.

## 1. Validate Demand & Set a Goal

- Walk target neighborhoods; count homes already using professional lawn services.
- Target 20–30 weekly clients clustered within a few ZIP codes to maximize route density.

## 2. Choose a Legal Structure & Register

- Form an **LLC** online via the Colorado Secretary of State (filing fee ≈ $50).

## 3. Secure Local Licenses & Handle Taxes

- No general business license required by Grand Junction for mowing.
- Apply for a **city sales-tax license** if selling products (e.g., fertilizer). [gj](https://www.gjcity.org/355/Licenses-Permits?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Obtain a Colorado Commercial Pesticide Applicator license before offering weed-control or spraying. [gp](https://www.yourgreenpal.com/blog/do-i-need-a-license-to-run-a-lawn-care-business?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [maple](https://maplescapes.com/landscaping-license-colorado/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
